\chapter{Topics in Trigonometry}
\subsection*{Understanding the Basic Trig Functions}

\section*{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
Trigonometry is important in pre-calculus studies.

\section{The Unit Circle}
\label{sec:unit_circle}

The unit circle is a fundamental concept in trigonometry. It is a circle with a radius of one unit, centered at the origin (0,0) of the coordinate plane. The unit circle allows us to define all trigonometric functions for any angle, including those greater than 90 degrees.

\subsection{Definition of the Unit Circle}
\label{subsec:unit_circle_definition}

The unit circle is defined as the set of all points \((x, y)\) that satisfy the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). This circle intersects the x-axis at the points \((1, 0)\) and \((-1, 0)\), and the y-axis at the points \((0, 1)\) and \((0, -1)\).

\subsection{Angles and the Unit Circle}
\label{subsec:angles_unit_circle}

In the context of the unit circle, an angle \(\theta\) is defined starting from the positive x-axis and rotating counter-clockwise for positive angles and clockwise for negative angles. This rotation creates an arc on the circle, and the length of this arc is the measure of the angle in radians.

\subsection{Radians and Degrees}
\label{subsec:radians_degrees}

A radian is the measure of an angle corresponding to an arc length equal to the radius of the circle. Since the circumference of the unit circle is \(2\pi\), there are \(2\pi\) radians in a full rotation. To convert radians to degrees, we use the fact that \(360\) degrees is equivalent to \(2\pi\) radians. Therefore, to convert an angle from radians to degrees, we multiply by \(\frac{180}{\pi}\).

\[
\text{degrees} = \text{radians} \times \frac{180}{\pi}
\]

Conversely, to convert from degrees to radians, we multiply by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\).

\[
\text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}
\]

\subsection{Graphing the Unit Circle}
\label{subsec:graphing_unit_circle}

Let's graph the unit circle with the point \((0,1)\) marked:

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
    % Draw the unit circle
    \draw (0,0) circle (2cm);
    % Draw the horizontal and vertical lines
    \draw[->] (-2.5,0) -- (2.5,0) node[right] {\(x\)};
    \draw[->] (0,-2.5) -- (0,2.5) node[above] {\(y\)};
    % Draw the point (0,1)
    \filldraw [black] (0,2) circle (2pt) node[right] {\((0,1)\)};
    % Draw the angle
    \draw[->] (1.5,0) arc (0:90:1.5cm);
    % Label the angle
    \node at (1.2,0.3) {\(\theta\)};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{The unit circle with the point (0,1) marked.}
\label{fig:unit_circle}
\end{figure}

As you can see from Figure \ref{fig:unit_circle}, the unit circle provides a way to visualize angles and trigonometric functions. Each point on the circle corresponds to the cosine and sine of the angle \(\theta\), where the x-coordinate represents the cosine, and the y-coordinate represents the sine.

% End of the unit circle section

% --- Chapter: Trigonometry ---
\chapter{Trigonometry for Calculus}
\label{chap:trigonometry}

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles. It is essential for understanding concepts in calculus, as it provides tools for modeling and solving problems involving periodic phenomena.

% \section{Angles and Their Measure}
% \label{sec:angles_measure}
% Every study of Trigonometry begins with an understanding of angles. Here, we discuss how angles are measured in both degrees and radians, and the importance of radian measure in calculus.

\section{Angles and Their Measure}
\label{sec:angles_measure}

Every study of Trigonometry begins with an understanding of angles. Angles can be measured in two primary ways: degrees and radians. Degrees are traditionally used in many fields and cultures, and there are \(360\) degrees in a full rotation. Radians, however, provide a more natural approach in mathematics, especially calculus, because they arise from the arc length of a circle.

\subsection{Degree Measure}
\label{subsec:degree_measure}

One degree is defined as \(\frac{1}{360}\) of a full rotation. The degree measure is subdivided into minutes and seconds, where one degree contains \(60\) minutes and one minute contains \(60\) seconds.

\subsection{Radian Measure}
\label{subsec:radian_measure}

A radian is a measure based on the radius of a circle. It is the angle created at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. Since the circumference of a circle is \(2\pi\) times the radius, a full rotation contains \(2\pi\) radians.

\subsection{Converting Between Degrees and Radians}
\label{subsec:converting_degrees_radians}

To convert from degrees to radians, we use the relationship that \(180\) degrees is equal to \(\pi\) radians. Therefore, to convert \(x\) degrees to radians, we multiply \(x\) by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\).

\[
\text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}
\]

Conversely, to convert from radians to degrees, we multiply the radian measure by \(\frac{180}{\pi}\).

\[
\text{degrees} = \text{radians} \times \frac{180}{\pi}
\]

\subsection{Visualizing Angles with TikZ}
\label{subsec:visualizing_angles}

To better understand how angles are measured, we can visualize them using a unit circle. Below, we depict an angle in both degrees and radians.

    \node at (1.5,0.8) {$r$};
\end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:angles_visualization} shows an angle $\theta$ measured in radians (in red) and the same angle measured in degrees (in blue). This visual aid helps to understand the relationship between the two units of measurement.

% \subsection{Degree Measure}
% \label{subsec:degree_measure}
% An angle's measure in degrees reflects the extent of rotation from the initial side to the terminal side.

\subsection{Degree Measure}
\label{subsec:degree_measure}
The measurement of an angle in degrees is a reflection of the rotation from the angle's initial side to its terminal side. One full rotation around a circle is equal to 360 degrees, meaning that a degree represents \(\frac{1}{360}\)th of a full rotation. This form of measurement originates from the ancient Babylonians, who had a base-60 number system and divided the circle into 360 parts.

To visualize an angle measured in degrees, consider the following figure created using the TikZ package. It shows an angle of 45 degrees, which is an eighth of a full 360-degree rotation.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2.5]
  % Draw the circle
  \draw (0,0) circle (1cm);
  
  % Draw the radius
  \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (0:1cm) node[below] {$(1,0)$};
  \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (45:1cm) node[above right] {$(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$};
  
  % Draw the arc for the angle
  \draw[->,red,thick] (0.5,0) arc (0:45:0.5cm);
  
  % Draw the angle

  % Draw the horizontal line
  \draw[dashed] (0.707,0) -- (0.707,0.707);
  
  % Label the origin
  \draw[fill=black] (0,0) circle (0.5pt) node[below left] {$O$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Illustration of a \(45^\circ\) angle in standard position.}
\label{fig:45degangle}
\end{figure}

The figure above illustrates an angle whose terminal side has rotated \(45^\circ\) from the positive x-axis, which is often referred to as the angle's initial side. The radius of the circle has a length of 1, hence the name "unit circle." The coordinates \((1,0)\) and \((\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\) correspond to the points where the radius intersects the x-axis and the circle, respectively. The dashed line represents the y-component of the terminal side's endpoint, helping to visualize the \(45^\circ\) angle as a right triangle within the circle.

Angles in degrees are widely used in various fields, including navigation, astronomy, and in everyday situations like measuring temperatures and geographic coordinates. Understanding how to measure angles in degrees and relate them to rotations is fundamental in trigonometry.

% \subsection{Radian Measure}
% \label{subsec:radian_measure}
% Radian measure is crucial in calculus because it simplifies the derivatives and integrals of trigonometric functions.

\subsection{Radian Measure}
\label{subsec:radian_measure}

The radian measure of an angle is the length of the arc on the unit circle subtended by the angle. One radian is the angle subtended by an arc length equal to the radius of the circle. Since the circumference of a unit circle is \(2\pi\) times the radius, a full rotation around the circle is \(2\pi\) radians.

\subsubsection*{Why Use Radians?}
In calculus, radian measure is preferred because it provides a direct relationship between the angle measure and the arc length. This relationship simplifies the computation of derivatives and integrals involving trigonometric functions. For instance, when using radians, the derivative of \(\sin x\) is simply \(\cos x\), and the derivative of \(\cos x\) is \(-\sin x\). Such simplicity is not evident when using degrees.

\subsubsection*{Visualizing Radian Measure}
To visualize an angle in radian measure, we plot it on the unit circle:

\end{tikzpicture}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Solutions}
\begin{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
      \item \( 180^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \pi \text{ radians} \)
      \item \( 360^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = 2\pi \text{ radians} \)
      \item \( 90^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ radians} \)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item The length of an arc \( l \) is directly proportional to the angle \( \theta \) in radians, such that \( l = r\theta \).
  \item The radian measure of the angle is \( \theta = \frac{l}{r} = \frac{15 \text{ units}}{10 \text{ units}} = 1.5 \text{ radians} \).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems}
Here are some practice problems to help you solidify your understanding of the radian measure:

\textbf{Problem 1:} Convert the following angles from radians to degrees:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]

\textbf{Problem 5:} The wheel of a bicycle has a diameter of 70 cm. If the wheel rolls without slipping and turns through an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians, how far has the bicycle traveled?

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Practice Problems}

\textbf{Solution to Problem 1:} To convert radians to degrees, multiply by \( \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \).

% \section{Trigonometric Functions}
% \label{sec:trigonometric_functions}
% The six trigonometric functions are the primary tools for handling problems involving triangles in Trigonometry and periodic phenomena in calculus.

\section{Trigonometric Functions}
\label{sec:trigonometric_functions}
The six trigonometric functions are fundamental in both Trigonometry and calculus. These functions are sine (\(\sin\)), cosine (\(\cos\)), tangent (\(\tan\)), cosecant (\(\csc\)), secant (\(\sec\)), and cotangent (\(\cot\)). They are defined as ratios of sides in a right triangle or as certain coordinates of points on the unit circle.

\subsection{Sine and Cosine}
\label{subsec:sine_cosine}
The sine function (\(\sin\)) represents the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle. The cosine function (\(\cos\)) represents the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.

For a point \((x, y)\) on the unit circle corresponding to an angle \(\theta\), the sine and cosine values are \(y\) and \(x\), respectively.

\subsubsection*{Graph of Sine and Cosine Functions}
We can graph the sine and cosine functions using their values from the unit circle.

% Graphing sine and cosine functions
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    width=10cm, height=6cm,
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = {$\theta$},
    ylabel = {$y$},
    ymin=-1.5, ymax=1.5,
    xmin=-0.5, xmax=6.5,
    xtick={0,1.57,3.14,4.71,6.28},
    xticklabels={0,$\frac{\pi}{2}$,$\pi$,$\frac{3\pi}{2}$,$2\pi$},
    ytick={-1,1},
    every axis x label/.style={at={(ticklabel* cs:1)},anchor=west},
    every axis y label/.style={at={(ticklabel* cs:1)},anchor=south},
    ]
    \addplot[domain=0:2*pi,samples=100,blue] {sin(deg(x))};
    \addplot[domain=0:2*pi,samples=100,red] {cos(deg(x))};
    \legend{$\sin(\theta)$,$\cos(\theta)$}
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The sine function starts at \(0\), reaches its maximum at \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), returns to \(0\) at \(\pi\), reaches its minimum at \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\), and completes the cycle at \(2\pi\).

The cosine function starts at \(1\), drops to \(0\) at \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), reaches its minimum at \(\pi\), returns to \(0\) at \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\), and completes the cycle at \(2\pi\).

\subsection{Tangent Function}
\label{subsec:tangent_function}
The tangent function (\(\tan\)) is defined as the ratio of the sine to the cosine of an angle in a right triangle, or \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}\). It represents the slope of the line that intersects the unit circle at an angle \(\theta\).

\subsection{Reciprocal Functions}
\label{subsec:reciprocal_functions}
The reciprocal functions, cosecant (\(\csc\)), secant (\(\sec\)), and cotangent (\(\cot\)), are the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, respectively.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Cosecant (\(\csc(\theta)\)) is the reciprocal of sine: \(\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}\)
  \item Secant (\(\sec(\theta)\)) is the reciprocal of cosine: \(\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}\)
  \item Cotangent (\(\cot(\theta)\)) is the reciprocal of tangent: \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)}\)
\end{itemize}

      \item \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)
      \item \(\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)}{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\)

      \item \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\)
    \end{itemize}
  \item For \(\cos(\theta) = -\frac{1}{2}\) in the third quadrant:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(\sin(\theta)\) must also be negative in the third quadrant, and \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\), so \(\sin(\theta) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

% \subsection{Sine and Cosine}
% \label{subsec:sine_cosine}
% The sine and cosine functions relate an angle to the opposite side and hypotenuse, and adjacent side and hypotenuse of a right triangle, respectively.

\subsection{Sine and Cosine}
\label{subsec:sine_cosine}

The sine and cosine functions are fundamental to trigonometry. They are defined for a given angle \( \theta \) within a right-angled triangle as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{sine} of angle \( \theta \), written as \( \sin(\theta) \), is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.
    \item The \textbf{cosine} of angle \( \theta \), written as \( \cos(\theta) \), is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.
\end{itemize}

However, these definitions are not limited to angles between 0 and \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians (or 0 and 90 degrees). By extending the concept of the unit circle, where the radius is 1 and the center is at the origin of a coordinate plane, we can define sine and cosine for any real angle.

\subsubsection*{Sine and Cosine on the Unit Circle}
Consider the unit circle with a point \( P(x, y) \) that corresponds to an angle \( \theta \) measured from the positive x-axis. The coordinates \( x \) and \( y \) of point \( P \) on the unit circle are equal to \( \cos(\theta) \) and \( \sin(\theta) \), respectively.

The unit circle approach allows for a seamless transition of sine and cosine from acute angles to any angle in the coordinate plane. The definitions on the unit circle are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For any angle \( \theta \), \( \sin(\theta) \) is the y-coordinate of the corresponding point on the unit circle.
    \item For any angle \( \theta \), \( \cos(\theta) \) is the x-coordinate of the corresponding point on the unit circle.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Properties of Sine and Cosine Functions}

The sine and cosine functions have several important properties that are useful in various mathematical analyses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item They are periodic functions with a period of \( 2\pi \) radians (or 360 degrees).
    \item The sine function is odd: \( \sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta) \).
    \item The cosine function is even: \( \cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta) \).
    \item The maximum value of both functions is 1, and the minimum value is -1.
    \item They satisfy the Pythagorean identity: \( \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1 \).
\end{itemize}

Understanding these functions and their properties is crucial for solving problems involving periodic behavior and waves, and they are the building blocks for defining the other trigonometric functions.

% Further discussion and examples can be added here as needed.

\subsubsection*{Example Problems}
Below are some problems that help solidify the understanding of sine and cosine functions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given that \( P(x, y) \) is a point on the unit circle corresponding to an angle \( \theta \), and \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), find \( y \) and hence \( \sin(\theta) \) and \( \cos(\theta) \).
    \item Prove the Pythagorean identity \( \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1 \) using the definition of sine and cosine on the unit circle.
    \item If \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{3}{5} \) and \( \theta \) is in the first quadrant, find \( \cos(\theta) \).
    \item For an angle \( \theta \) with \( \cos(\theta) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( \frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \pi \), determine \( \sin(\theta) \).
    \item Using the unit circle, find the exact values of \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{6}) \), \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) \), \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) \), \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{6}) \), \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) \), and \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{3}) \).
    \item Sketch the unit circle and mark the points where \( \sin(\theta) = \cos(\theta) \). What are the angles \( \theta \) at these points?
\end{enumerate}

% Answers to the example problems
\subsubsection*{Answers to Example Problems}

Here are the answers to the example problems provided:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Since \( x = \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \), we have \( y = \sin(\theta) = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).
    \item To prove the identity, we use the fact that for any point on the unit circle, the distance from the origin to the point is 1. Hence, \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Since \( x = \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = \sin(\theta) \), it follows that \( \cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1 \).
    \item Since \( \theta \) is in the first quadrant, both sine and cosine are positive. Using the Pythagorean identity, \( \cos(\theta) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(\theta)} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{9}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{16}{25}} = \frac{4}{5} \).
    \item In the second quadrant, sine is positive and cosine is negative. Using the Pythagorean identity, \( \sin(\theta) = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(\theta)} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
    \item For the specified angles, the exact values can be determined from the known special angles on the unit circle: \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{1}{2} \), \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{1}{2} \).
    \item On the unit circle, \( \sin(\theta) = \cos(\theta) \) at \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \theta = \frac{5\pi}{4} \). These correspond to the points \( (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \) and \( (-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \), respectively.

% \subsection{Tangent and Cotangent}
% \label{subsec:tangent_cotangent}
% These functions are the ratios of sine to cosine and cosine to sine, respectively, and they play a significant role in slope calculations in calculus.

% \usepackage{pgfplots}
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.17}

\subsection{Tangent and Cotangent}
\label{subsec:tangent_cotangent}

The tangent of an angle in a right-angled triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. In the unit circle, tangent is the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate when the line made by the angle intersects the circle. Symbolically, for an angle \(\theta\), this is expressed as:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}
\]

Conversely, the cotangent is the reciprocal of the tangent function. It represents the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the opposite side, or using the unit circle, the x-coordinate divided by the y-coordinate:
\[
\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}
\]

These functions are undefined when their denominators are zero (i.e., when \(\cos(\theta) = 0\) for tangent, and when \(\sin(\theta) = 0\) for cotangent). This occurs at odd multiples of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) for tangent and at integer multiples of \(\pi\) for cotangent.

The graphs of these functions illustrate their periodic nature and the locations of their asymptotes, which correspond to the angles where the functions are undefined.

\subsection{Exercises on Tangent and Cotangent Functions}
\label{subsec:exercises_tangent_cotangent}

In this section, we provide some example problems involving the tangent and cotangent functions. These exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts discussed and help students gain a deeper understanding of these trigonometric functions.

% \begin{exercise}[1]
%   Prove that \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) for a right triangle with legs of length \(a\) and \(b\), and hypotenuse of length \(c\).
% \end{exercise}

% \begin{solution}
%   (Write your solution here)
% \end{solution}

% Numbering is optional, i.e.
% \begin{exercise}[1]
% \begin{exercise}[2]


\begin{exercise}
Calculate the tangent of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) and verify that it equals 1.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
Using the unit circle or the definition of the tangent function, we have:
\[
\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 1
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Find all solutions in the interval \([0, 2\pi)\) for the equation \(\tan(\theta) = \sqrt{3}\).
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
We know that \(\tan(\theta) = \sqrt{3}\) when \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}\), but since tangent has a period of \(\pi\), the other solution in the given interval is \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{3} + \pi = \frac{4\pi}{3}\).
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Evaluate \(\cot(\pi)\) and explain why it takes its particular value.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
Cotangent is the reciprocal of the tangent function. Since \(\tan(\pi) = 0\), and since the cotangent is undefined when its sine component is 0 (which it is at \(\pi\)), \(\cot(\pi)\) is undefined. This reflects the asymptote of the cotangent graph at \(\pi\).
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Determine the exact value of \(\cot\left(-\frac{\pi}{6}\right)\) using the cotangent definition.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
Using the cotangent definition and known values of sine and cosine for \(\frac{\pi}{6}\), we get:
\[
\cot\left(-\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{6}\right)}{\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{6}\right)} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{-\frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Sketch the graph of \(\tan(\theta)\) and \(\cot(\theta)\) from \(\theta = -\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\theta = \frac{3\pi}{2}\) and label the asymptotes.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
Students should refer to the graphs provided in the section above and reproduce them by hand, marking the asymptotes at \(\theta = -\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for the tangent function and at \(\theta = 0\), \(\theta = \pi\) for the cotangent function.
\end{solution}

These exercises require students to apply their understanding of the unit circle, the definitions of tangent and cotangent, and the properties of these functions such as periodicity and asymptotes. Students should attempt these exercises without a calculator to improve their understanding of the trigonometric functions.

\section{Graphs of Trigonometric Functions}
\label{sec:graphs_trig_functions}

The graphs of trigonometric functions are a visual representation of their behavior and are essential for understanding periodic phenomena in calculus. In this section, we'll explore the sine and cosine functions, which form the basis for all other trigonometric functions.

\subsection{Graph of the Sine Function}
The sine function, denoted by \( y = \sin(x) \), represents the y-coordinate of a point on the unit circle as it rotates through an angle of \( x \) radians. It is periodic with a period of \( 2\pi \) and has a range from -1 to 1.

Both of these functions exhibit properties that are useful in calculus, including symmetry, periodicity, and amplitude. Sine and cosine functions are the building blocks of more complex trigonometric functions, which can be constructed by shifting, stretching, or compressing these basic graphs.

\subsection{Exercises}
Practice the concepts we've discussed by working through the following exercises.

\subsubsection*{Graph Identification}

\paragraph{Exercise 1.} Identify the function graphed below. What are the amplitude, period, and phase shift of the function?

% Example plot for the exercise (Placeholder for the actual plot)
% You can draw a shifted or stretched sine/cosine function as an exercise
\begin{figure}[H]

    ymin=-2, ymax=2,
    xmin=-2*pi, xmax=2*pi,
    domain=-2*pi:2*pi,

% A shifted sine function as an example
\addplot [blue, thick] {1.5*sin(deg(x-pi/4))};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Identify the function and its characteristics.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Answer:} The graph shows \( y = 1.5\sin(x - \frac{\pi}{4}) \). The amplitude is 1.5, the period is \( 2\pi \), and the phase shift is \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) to the right.

\subsubsection*{Function Properties}

\paragraph{Exercise 2.} What is the amplitude and period of the function \( y = 3\cos(2x) \)?

\paragraph{Answer:} The amplitude of the function is 3, and the period is \( \frac{\pi}{1} \), which is \( \pi \) since the coefficient of \( x \) in the cosine function affects the period as \( \frac{2\pi}{\text{coefficient}} \).

\subsubsection*{Calculating Values}

\paragraph{Exercise 3.} Calculate the exact value of \( \sin(\frac{3\pi}{4}) \) and \( \cos(\frac{3\pi}{4}) \).

\paragraph{Answer:} By using the unit circle or Pythagorean identities:
\[ \sin(\frac{3\pi}{4}) = \sin(\pi - \frac{\pi}{4}) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ \cos(\frac{3\pi}{4}) = \cos(\pi - \frac{\pi}{4}) = -\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

\subsubsection*{Real-World Application}

\paragraph{Exercise 4.} A Ferris wheel with a diameter of 50 meters makes one complete revolution every 2 minutes. Write a function that represents the height of a passenger car above the ground over time, assuming it starts at the lowest point at \( t=0 \).

\paragraph{Answer:} Let the height function be \( h(t) \). The amplitude is the radius of the Ferris wheel, which is 25 meters. The period is the time for one revolution, which is 2 minutes, or 120 seconds. Using the sine function, we get:
\[ h(t) = 25\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{120}t\right) + 25 \]
This function accounts for the fact that the Ferris wheel starts at the lowest point, so we add 25 to shift the graph up.

\subsubsection*{Challenge Problems}

\paragraph{Exercise 5.} Given the function \( y = 2\sin(x) + \cos(2x) \), find the first derivative using trigonometric identities.

% Solution for the exercise is provided as a placeholder for actual calculation
\paragraph{Answer:} First, express \( \cos(2x) \) using a double-angle identity:
\[ y = 2\sin(x) + 1 - 2\sin^2(x) \]
Then, take the derivative with respect to \( x \):
\[ y' = 2\cos(x) - 4\sin(x)\cos(x) \]

These exercises encourage students to apply their understanding of the graphs of sine and cosine functions to solve problems and understand real-world applications. Adjust the complexity and nature of the exercises to match the level of your audience.

% \subsection{Periodicity}
% \label{subsec:periodicity}
% The concept of period, amplitude, and phase shift is introduced here to understand how trigonometric functions behave over intervals.

\subsection{Periodicity}
\label{subsec:periodicity}

Trigonometric functions are inherently periodic; they repeat their values in regular intervals along the domain. This periodic nature allows us to predict the behavior of these functions beyond the basic interval of \(0\) to \(2\pi\) for sine and cosine, and \( -\pi/2 \) to \( \pi/2 \) for tangent and cotangent.
In sum, The concept of period, amplitude, and phase shift is introduced here to understand how trigonometric functions behave over intervals.

\subsubsection*{Defining Periodicity}
The \textit{period} of a function is the smallest positive interval after which the function's values repeat. For \( \sin(x) \) and \( \cos(x) \), the period is \(2\pi\) because every \(2\pi\) units, the cycle of the sine and cosine curve repeats. For \( \tan(x) \) and \( \cot(x) \), the period is \( \pi \) since their values repeat after every \( \pi \) units along the x-axis.

\subsubsection*{Amplitude}
The amplitude of a trigonometric function is a measure of its vertical stretch or compression, represented by a coefficient in front of the function. For example, in the function \( y = A\sin(x) \), the amplitude is \( |A| \). This determines the maximum and minimum values of the function or, in other words, how "tall" or "short" the waves of the sine or cosine graph appear.

\subsubsection*{Phase Shift}
Phase shift refers to the horizontal displacement of the basic function. If a function takes the form \( y = \sin(x - C) \) or \( y = \cos(x - C) \), the phase shift is \( C \), which translates the graph to the right or left along the x-axis.

\subsubsection*{Graphing Trigonometric Functions}
To graph trigonometric functions that involve amplitude, period, and phase shifts, the following general form can be considered:

\[ y = A \sin(B(x - C)) + D \quad \text{or} \quad y = A \cos(B(x - C)) + D \]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( A \) represents the amplitude.
    \item \( B \) affects the period of the function, with the actual period being \( \frac{2\pi}{|B|} \).
    \item \( C \) represents the phase shift.
    \item \( D \) represents the vertical shift.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Graphical Illustration}
Let's illustrate a sine function with a period alteration and phase shift.

Understanding these properties enables us to graph complex trigonometric functions and predict their behavior across any range of \( x \) values. This comprehension is vital in calculus where the manipulation of these functions' properties can be necessary for solving integrals and derivatives involving trigonometric functions.

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems}
To further enhance understanding of periodicity in trigonometric functions, here are several practice problems:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given the function \( f(x) = 3 \sin(2x) \), find the amplitude, period, and whether there is any phase shift.
    \item Sketch the graph of \( g(x) = \cos(x - \frac{\pi}{3}) \) and identify the phase shift and period.
    \item For the function \( h(x) = 2 \sin(\frac{x}{2} + \pi) + 1 \), determine the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift. Then, sketch one period of the function's graph.
    \item What is the period and phase shift of the function \( j(x) = \tan(3x - \frac{\pi}{4}) \)?
    \item If \( k(x) = \sin(Bx) \) has a period of \( 3\pi \), find the value of \( B \).
    \item Sketch the graph of \( m(x) = -2 \cos(4x + \frac{\pi}{2}) - 3 \) and indicate the amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solutions:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The amplitude of \( f(x) \) is \( |3| = 3 \), the period is \( \frac{2\pi}{|2|} = \pi \), and there is no phase shift.
    \item The graph of \( g(x) \) would show a cosine curve shifted to the right by \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) units, with a period of \( 2\pi \).
    \item For \( h(x) \), the amplitude is \( |2| = 2 \), the period is \( \frac{2\pi}{|\frac{1}{2}|} = 4\pi \), the phase shift is \( -\pi \) (shifted \( \pi \) units to the left), and the vertical shift is \( 1 \) unit upwards.
    \item The function \( j(x) \) has a period of \( \frac{\pi}{|3|} = \frac{\pi}{3} \) and a phase shift of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) to the right.
    \item Since the period of \( k(x) \) is \( 3\pi \), \( B = \frac{2\pi}{3\pi} = \frac{2}{3} \).
    \item The graph of \( m(x) \) would be an inverted cosine curve (due to the "-2" amplitude) stretched by a factor of \( \frac{1}{4} \) (since the period is \( \frac{2\pi}{|4|} = \frac{\pi}{2} \)), shifted to the left by \( -\frac{\pi}{8} \), and shifted downward by 3 units.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Transformations}
\label{subsec:transformations}

Trigonometric functions, much like any other functions, can undergo transformations such as scaling, reflection, and translation. These transformations allow us to alter the amplitude, period, and phase of the sine and cosine functions to fit various scenarios. In this section, we explore each of these transformations and how they apply to trigonometric functions. In sum, we explore how the basic sine and cosine graphs can be scaled, reflected, and translated to fit various scenarios.

In sum, we have begun to explore how the basic sine and cosine graphs can be scaled, reflected, and translated to fit various scenarios.

\subsubsection{Scaling}
Scaling a function can either compress or stretch its graph vertically or horizontally. The amplitude and period of trigonometric functions are affected by vertical and horizontal scaling respectively.

\textbf{Vertical Scaling:} If \( f(x) = \sin(x) \), then \( g(x) = A\sin(x) \) represents a vertical scaling by a factor of \( A \). If \( A > 1 \), the function is stretched; if \( 0 < A < 1 \), it is compressed.

\textbf{Horizontal Scaling:} Horizontal scaling affects the period of the trigonometric functions. For \( f(x) = \sin(x) \), the function \( h(x) = \sin(Bx) \) has a period of \( \frac{2\pi}{B} \), scaling the period by a factor of \( \frac{1}{B} \).

\subsubsection{Reflection}
Reflection flips the graph of the function over a specific axis. 

\textbf{Reflection over the X-axis:} If \( f(x) = \sin(x) \), then \( g(x) = -\sin(x) \) is a reflection of \( f \) over the x-axis.

\textbf{Reflection over the Y-axis:} For \( f(x) = \sin(x) \), the function \( h(x) = \sin(-x) = -\sin(x) \) (since sine is an odd function) reflects \( f \) over the y-axis.

% HERE

\subsubsection{Translation}
Translation shifts the graph of the function vertically or horizontally without altering its shape.

\textbf{Vertical Translation:} The function \( f(x) = \sin(x) + D \) represents a vertical shift by \( D \) units. If \( D > 0 \), the graph shifts up; if \( D < 0 \), it shifts down.

\textbf{Horizontal Translation (Phase Shift):} For \( f(x) = \sin(x) \), the function \( g(x) = \sin(x - C) \) shifts the graph to the right by \( C \) units if \( C > 0 \) and to the left if \( C < 0 \).

To visualize these transformations, consider the following graphs created with the TikZ package.

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sine_transformations}, each transformation alters the original sine function in a unique way, illustrating the concepts of scaling, reflection, and translation. Through understanding these transformations, one can analyze and predict the behavior of more complex trigonometric functions.

\subsection{Practice Problems}
\label{subsec:practice_problems_transformations}

In this section, we provide several problems that allow students to apply their knowledge of transformations of trigonometric functions. Students should sketch the graph of each transformed function and identify key characteristics such as amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift.

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}

\end{solution}

\begin{solution}

\cos(\alpha) - \cos(\beta) &= -2\sin\left(\frac{\alpha + \beta}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{\alpha - \beta}{2}\right)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Reduction Formulas}
\label{subsec:reduction_formulas}
Reduction formulas are a type of recurrence relation that express trigonometric functions of a larger angle in terms of functions of a smaller angle. These are particularly useful in integration and series expansion of trigonometric functions.

% Examples of reduction formulas can be provided here

Each subsection could be further expanded with examples, proofs, and applications of these identities in calculus. Moreover, practice problems could be provided to help students gain proficiency in using these identities to simplify and solve trigonometric equations.

\subsection{Practice Problems}
\label{subsec:practice_problems_trig_identities}

To apply the trigonometric identities outlined above, try solving the following problems. These will test your understanding and ability to manipulate the identities to simplify expressions and solve equations.

\begin{problem}
Use the Pythagorean identity to find $\sin(\theta)$ if $\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}$ and $\theta$ is in the first quadrant.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Since $\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}$ and $\theta$ is in the first quadrant, where sine is positive,
\begin{align*}
\sin(\theta) &= \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(\theta)} \\
&= \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2} \\
&= \sqrt{1 - \frac{9}{25}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{16}{25}} \\
&= \frac{4}{5}.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Prove the double angle identity for sine using the angle sum identity for sine:
\[

\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Using the angle sum identity for sine, $\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)$, let $\alpha = \beta = \theta$:
\begin{align*}

\begin{align*}
\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) &= \frac{1 - \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \\
&= \frac{1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} \\
&= \sqrt{2} - 1.

% These problems can be expanded upon, and more can be added to provide a comprehensive set of exercises covering the different identities. Additionally, figures and diagrams can be included using `tikz` to illustrate the concepts where appropriate.

% \subsection{Pythagorean Identities}
% \label{subsec:pythagorean_identities}
% These identities express fundamental relationships between the sine and cosine of the same angle.

\subsection{Pythagorean Identities}
\label{subsec:pythagorean_identities}

The Pythagorean identities are a direct consequence of the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right triangle on the unit circle. For any angle $\theta$, the following fundamental relationships hold true:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The primary Pythagorean identity:
    \[
    \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1
    \]
    \item Derived from the primary identity, the other two Pythagorean identities are:
    \[
    1 + \tan^2(\theta) = \sec^2(\theta)
    \]
    \[
    1 + \cot^2(\theta) = \csc^2(\theta)
    \]
\end{itemize}

These identities are immensely useful in simplifying trigonometric expressions, solving trigonometric equations, and converting between trigonometric functions. Let's visualize the primary Pythagorean identity on the unit circle:

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Visualization of the primary Pythagorean identity on the unit circle.}
\label{fig:unitcircle_pythagorean}
\end{figure}

As the figure demonstrates, for any point on the unit circle at an angle $\theta$ from the positive x-axis, the x-coordinate is $\cos(\theta)$ and the y-coordinate is $\sin(\theta)$. Since the radius of the unit circle is 1, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have that $\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1^2$.

\textbf{Example:} To see these identities in action, consider the angle $\frac{\pi}{4}$. For this angle, we know that $\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Therefore,

\begin{align*}
    \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) &= \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 \\
    &= \frac{2}{4} + \frac{2}{4} \\
    &= \frac{4}{4} \\
    &= 1,
\end{align*}

which confirms the primary Pythagorean identity.


\subsection{Practice Problems}
\label{subsec:pythagorean_practice_problems}

To further solidify your understanding of Pythagorean identities, try solving the following problems:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verify the identity $\tan^2(\theta) + 1 = \sec^2(\theta)$ for $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$.
    \item Prove that $\csc^2(\theta) - \cot^2(\theta) = 1$ using the primary Pythagorean identity.
    \item Simplify the expression $\sin^2(x) \cdot \sec^2(x)$ using Pythagorean identities.
    \item Given that $\sin(\alpha) = \frac{3}{5}$ and $\alpha$ is in the first quadrant, find the values of $\cos(\alpha)$, $\tan(\alpha)$, and $\cot(\alpha)$.
    \item If $\cos(\beta) = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\beta$ is an acute angle, determine the exact values of $\sin(\beta)$, $\tan(\beta)$, and $\sec(\beta)$.
    \item Show that $\sin(\theta) \cdot \tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$ and simplify the expression.
\end{enumerate}

Solutions to Practice Problems:

\textbf{Note to instructor:} The solutions provided below are for your reference and should not be shared with the students until after they have attempted to solve the problems on their own.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$, $\tan(\theta) = \sqrt{3}$ and $\sec(\theta) = 2$. Then,
    \[
    \tan^2\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + 1 = (\sqrt{3})^2 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 = \sec^2\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right).
    \]

    \item Starting with $\csc^2(\theta) = 1 + \cot^2(\theta)$,
    \[
    \csc^2(\theta) - \cot^2(\theta) = (1 + \cot^2(\theta)) - \cot^2(\theta) = 1.
    \]

    \item Simplifying $\sin^2(x) \cdot \sec^2(x)$:
    \[
    \sin^2(x) \cdot \sec^2(x) = \sin^2(x) \cdot \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} = \tan^2(x).
    \]

    \item Given $\sin(\alpha) = \frac{3}{5}$:
    \[
    \cos(\alpha) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(\alpha)} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2} = \frac{4}{5},
    \]
    \[
    \tan(\alpha) = \frac{\sin(\alpha)}{\cos(\alpha)} = \frac{3/5}{4/5} = \frac{3}{4},
    \]
    \[
    \cot(\alpha) = \frac{1}{\tan(\alpha)} = \frac{4}{3}.
    \]

    \item If $\cos(\beta) = \frac{1}{2}$:
    \[
    \sin(\beta) = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(\beta)} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},
    \]
    \[
    \tan(\beta) = \frac{\sin(\beta)}{\cos(\beta)} = \frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{1/2} = \sqrt{3},
    \]
    \[
    \sec(\beta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\beta)} = 2.
    \]

    \item For $\sin(\theta) \cdot \tan(\theta)$:
    \[
    \sin(\theta) \cdot \tan(\theta) = \sin(\theta) \cdot \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}.
    \]

% These formulas allow the calculation of the sine, cosine, and tangent of the sum or difference of two angles.

\subsection{Sum and Difference Formulas}
\label{subsec:sum_difference_formulas}

The sum and difference formulas are a cornerstone in trigonometry, allowing us to find the sine, cosine, and tangent of the sum or difference of two angles using the known values of these functions for the two angles. They can be stated as follows:

\begin{align*}
\sin(\alpha \pm \beta) &= \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) \pm \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta) \\
\cos(\alpha \pm \beta) &= \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) \mp \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) \\
\tan(\alpha \pm \beta) &= \frac{\tan(\alpha) \pm \tan(\beta)}{1 \mp \tan(\alpha)\tan(\beta)}
\end{align*}

These identities are particularly useful in calculus for integrating products of sine and cosine functions and solving trigonometric equations.

\label{fig:sum_of_angles}
\end{figure}

To gain a better understanding and reinforce these concepts, it is advised to work through some example problems:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given that $\sin(\pi/6) = 1/2$ and $\cos(\pi/3) = 1/2$, calculate $\sin(\pi/6 + \pi/3)$.
    \item If $\cos(45^\circ) = \sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, find the value of $\cos(45^\circ - 45^\circ)$.
    \item Determine $\tan(75^\circ)$ using the tangent sum formula, given that $75^\circ = 45^\circ + 30^\circ$.
\end{enumerate}

The above figure aids in visualizing how the sum of angles is represented within the unit circle, which can further help in understanding how the sum and difference formulas are derived geometrically.

\subsubsection{Practice Problems}
\label{subsubsec:practice_problems_sum_difference}

To ensure a solid grasp of the sum and difference formulas, practice the following problems:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluate $\sin(75^\circ)$ using the sum formula for sine with $\alpha = 45^\circ$ and $\beta = 30^\circ$.
    \item If $\cos(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, find the value of $\cos(60^\circ - 45^\circ)$.
    \item Using the difference formula for tangent, calculate $\tan(15^\circ)$ knowing that $\tan(45^\circ) = 1$ and $\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
    \item Verify the identity $\sin(\alpha + \beta)\sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sin^2(\alpha) - \sin^2(\beta)$ for $\alpha = 60^\circ$ and $\beta = 45^\circ$.
    \item A point P moves in such a way that the angle $\alpha$ it makes with the positive x-axis varies. If $\alpha$ increases at a constant rate of $30^\circ$ per second, express the $x$-coordinate of P, which is $\cos(\alpha)$, as a function of time $t$ in seconds.
\end{enumerate}

These problems combine the use of the sum and difference formulas with some algebraic manipulation and the fundamental trigonometric values for special angles. They serve as a good practice for students to apply these formulas in different contexts, which is a skill that will be beneficial in more advanced studies of mathematics, such as calculus.

% \subsection{Double-Angle and Half-Angle Formulas}
% \label{subsec:double_half_angle_formulas}
% These formulas are useful for integrating powers of sine and cosine functions.

\subsection{Double-Angle and Half-Angle Formulas}
\label{subsec:double_half_angle_formulas}

The double-angle formulas are derived from the sum formulas and provide the trigonometric functions of an angle that is double another. Similarly, the half-angle formulas give the functions of half of a given angle. These are particularly useful in integration and in solving trigonometric equations in calculus.

In conclusion, these formulas are useful for integrating powers of sine and cosine functions.

\subsubsection{Double-Angle Formulas}
\label{subsubsec:double_angle_formulas}
For any angle $\theta$, the double-angle formulas are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sine: $\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)$
    \item Cosine: $\cos(2\theta) = \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) = 2\cos^2(\theta) - 1 = 1 - 2\sin^2(\theta)$
    \item Tangent: $\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2\tan(\theta)}{1 - \tan^2(\theta)}$
\end{itemize}

The cosine double-angle formula has three variants, each useful depending on the context, especially in integration where one expression might be more convenient than the others.

\subsubsection{Half-Angle Formulas}
\label{subsubsec:half_angle_formulas}
The half-angle formulas are derived using the double-angle formulas and the Pythagorean identity. They allow us to express trigonometric functions of $\frac{\theta}{2}$ in terms of $\theta$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sine: $\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(\theta)}{2}}$
    \item Cosine: $\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos(\theta)}{2}}$
    \item Tangent: $\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(\theta)}{1 + \cos(\theta)}} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{1 + \cos(\theta)} = \frac{1 - \cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}$
\end{itemize}

The signs for the half-angle formulas depend on the quadrant in which the resulting half-angle lies. These formulas are essential in calculus for simplifying the integration of trigonometric functions and solving trigonometric equations.

\subsubsection{Visualization of Double-Angle and Half-Angle}
\label{subsubsec:visualization_double_half_angle}

To better understand the double-angle and half-angle concepts, it is often helpful to visualize them on the unit circle and through their graphs.

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = $\theta$,
    ylabel = {$f(\theta)$},
    legend pos = north west,

    xticklabels = {$-2\pi$, $-\frac{3\pi}{2}$, $-\pi$, $-\frac{\pi}{2}$, $0$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\pi$, $\frac{3\pi}{2}$, $2\pi$},
    ytick = {-1, 1},
    yticklabels = {$-1$, $1$},
    samples = 200,
    domain = -2*pi:2*pi
]

% Add the sine double-angle plot

\addlegendentry{$\sin(2\theta)$}

% Add the cosine double-angle plot

\addlegendentry{$\cos(2\theta)$}

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Graphs of $\sin(2\theta)$ and $\cos(2\theta)$.}
\end{figure}

In the graph, we see the effect of doubling the angle on the sine and cosine functions, where the frequency of the waveforms is doubled, reflecting the periodic nature of these functions.

\subsubsection{Problems for Reinforcement}
\label{subsubsec:problems_double_half_angle}
After reviewing the double-angle and half-angle formulas and observing their graphs, tackle the following problems to test your understanding:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Simplify the expression $\sin(4\theta)$ using the double-angle formula for sine.
    \item Given that $\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}$ and $\theta$ is in the first quadrant, find the exact value of $\cos(2\theta)$.
    \item Use the half-angle formula to determine $\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)$, given the cosine and sine of $\frac{\pi}{4}$.
    \item Derive the tangent half-angle formula starting from the sine and cosine half-angle formulas.

&= 2\cos^2(2\theta) - 1 \quad \text{(Double-angle formula)} \\
&= 2(2\cos^2(\theta) - 1)^2 - 1 \\
&= 2(4\cos^4(\theta) - 4\cos^2(\theta) + 1) - 1 \\
&= 8\cos^4(\theta) - 8\cos^2(\theta) + 1 \\
&= 8(1 - \sin^2(\theta))^2 - 8(1 - \sin^2(\theta)) + 1 \\

&= \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} \\

\text{Then, } \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) &= \sqrt{\frac{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}} \\

\end{align*}

% \section{Solving Trigonometric Equations}
% \label{sec:solving_trig_equations}
% We discuss how to solve basic trigonometric equations and how these principles apply to more complex equations in calculus.

\section{Solving Trigonometric Equations}
\label{sec:solving_trig_equations}

Solving trigonometric equations is a fundamental skill in calculus. These equations can often be solved by using algebraic techniques combined with trigonometric identities. In this section, we will explore various methods for solving trigonometric equations and apply these methods to more complex problems.

In sum, this section looks at how to solve basic trigonometric equations and how these principles apply to more complex equations in calculus.

\subsection{Algebraic Methods}
\label{subsec:algebraic_methods}
The first step in solving a trigonometric equation is to isolate the trigonometric function. This can be done through algebraic manipulation, such as adding or subtracting terms on both sides, factoring, or using the quadratic formula if applicable.

\subsubsection{Example}
Solve for \(\theta\) in the equation \(2\sin(\theta) + \sqrt{3} = 0\).

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{align*}
2\sin(\theta) &= -\sqrt{3} \\
\sin(\theta) &= -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\end{align*}
Now, we find the value of \(\theta\) within the desired interval, typically [0, 2\(\pi\)).

\subsection{Using Identities}
\label{subsec:using_identities}
Trigonometric identities, such as the Pythagorean identities, sum and difference formulas, and double-angle formulas, can be used to transform complex equations into simpler forms that are easier to solve.

\subsubsection{Example}
Solve for \(x\) in the equation \(\cos^2(x) - \sin(x) = 0\).

\textbf{Solution:}
Using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1\), we substitute \(\sin^2(x)\) with \(1 - \cos^2(x)\):
\begin{align*}
\cos^2(x) - \sin(x) &= 0 \\
1 - \sin^2(x) - \sin(x) &= 0 \\
\sin^2(x) + \sin(x) - 1 &= 0.
\end{align*}
Solving this quadratic equation in \(\sin(x)\), we find the values of \(x\) within the interval [0, 2\(\pi\)).

\subsection{Inverse Trigonometric Functions}
\label{subsec:inverse_trig_functions}
When the trigonometric function is isolated, we can use inverse trigonometric functions to find the angle corresponding to a given trigonometric ratio.

\subsubsection{Example}
Solve for \(\alpha\) in the equation \(\tan(\alpha) = 1\).

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{align*}
\alpha &= \arctan(1) \\
\alpha &= \frac{\pi}{4} + k\pi, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}.
\end{align*}
Since tangent has a period of \(\pi\), we include \(k\pi\) in the solution.

\subsection{Graphical Solutions}
\label{subsec:graphical_solutions}
Graphical methods can also be used to find solutions to trigonometric equations. By plotting the functions on both sides of the equation, the solutions are the x-coordinates of the intersection points.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    title={Graphical Solution of \(y = \sin(x)\) and \(y = \frac{1}{2}\)},
    xlabel={\(x\)},
    ylabel={\(y\)},
    xmin=0, xmax=2*pi,
    ymin=-1, ymax=1,
    axis lines=center,
    axis equal image,
    grid=major,
    grid style=dashed,
]

\addplot[
    domain=0:2*pi,
    samples=100,
    color=blue,
]
{sin(deg(x))};

\addplot[
    domain=0:2*pi,
    samples=100,
    color=red,
]
{0.5};

\addplot[
    mark=*, 
    only marks,
    color=black,
]
coordinates {
    (pi/6, 0.5) (5*pi/6, 0.5)
};

\node[pin=100:{\(\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{1}{2}\)}] at (axis cs:pi/6,0.5) {};
\node[pin=80:{\(\frac{5\pi}{6}, \frac{1}{2}\)}] at (axis cs:5*pi/6,0.5) {};

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

These graphical solutions correspond to the equation \(y = \sin(x)\) intersecting \(y = \frac{1}{2}\), indicating the solutions for \(x\) where \(\sin(x) = \frac{1}{2}\).

\subsection{Challenges in Calculus}
\label{subsec:challenges_calculus}
In calculus, trigonometric equations often arise within the context of differential equations, integrals, or series. The principles of solving simple trigonometric equations are applied, but often with additional techniques from calculus.

\subsubsection{Example}
Solve for \(\theta\) in the equation \(\frac{d}{d\theta}\sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta) = 0\), assuming \(\theta\) is in radians.

\textbf{Solution:}
First, we find the derivative of \(\sin(\theta)\):
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{d\theta}\sin(\theta) &= \cos(\theta) \\
\cos(\theta) + \cos(\theta) &= 0 \\
2\cos(\theta) &= 0.
\end{align*}
Solving for \(\theta\), we get \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi\), where \(k\) is an integer.

These are just introductory examples. More complex equations can be explored, including those involving multiple angles, products of trigonometric functions, and inverse trigonometric functions. Practice problems with varying difficulty should be provided to help students gain proficiency in solving trigonometric equations.

\subsection{Practice Problems}
\label{subsec:practice_problems}

To solidify your understanding of solving trigonometric equations, try to solve the following practice problems. Remember to use algebraic manipulation, trigonometric identities, inverse functions, and graphical insights where appropriate.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2\cos(x) - 1 = 0 \) for \( x \) in the interval \( [0, 2\pi) \).
    \item Find all angles \( \theta \) that satisfy the equation \( \tan(\theta) + \sqrt{3} = 0 \) for \( \theta \) in the interval \( [-\pi, \pi) \).
    \item Determine the solution set for \( \sin(2x) = \cos(x) \) within the interval \( [0, 2\pi) \).
    \item Solve \( \sin^2(x) - \sin(x) - 6 = 0 \) for all \( x \) in the interval \( [0, 2\pi) \).
    \item Using the double-angle formula, solve the equation \( \sin(x) - \cos(2x) = 0 \) for \( x \) in the interval \( [0, 2\pi) \).
    \item Graphically determine the solutions to \( \cos(x) = \sin(x) \) using a plot. Hint: Consider the lines \( y = \cos(x) \) and \( y = \sin(x) \) and find their points of intersection.
    \item For the differential equation \( \frac{d}{dx}\sin(x) + \sin(x) = 0 \), find the general solution.
    \item If \( \cos(3x) = \frac{1}{2} \), find all solutions for \( x \) within the interval \( [0, 2\pi) \).
    \item Prove that the equation \( \tan(x) = \cot(x) \) has no solutions for \( x \) in the interval \( (0, \pi) \).
    \item Solve the equation \( 3\sin(x) + 4\cos(x) = 2 \) by expressing it in the form \( R\sin(x + \alpha) \), where \( R > 0 \) and \( 0 \leq \alpha < 2\pi \).
\end{enumerate}

% Include your solutions below each problem.
% For example:
\textbf{Solution to Problem 1:}
\begin{align*}
2\cos(x) - 1 &= 0 \\
\cos(x) &= \frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*}
The solutions for \( x \) in the interval \( [0, 2\pi) \) are \( x = \frac{\pi}{3} \) and \( x = \frac{5\pi}{3} \).

% Students can continue with solutions to other problems in a similar fashion.

\textbf{Note:} It is beneficial to check your solutions with a graphing calculator or software that can plot trigonometric functions and their intersections.

\subsection{Linear Trigonometric Equations}
\label{subsec:linear_trig_equations}

Techniques for solving first-order trigonometric equations are outlined here.

Linear trigonometric equations are of the form \( A \cdot \text{trig\_function}(x) + B = 0 \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants, and the trig\_function can be \( \sin \), \( \cos \), or \( \tan \). To solve such equations, we isolate the trigonometric function and then find the angle \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

For example, consider the equation \( 2\sin(x) + 1 = 0 \). To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( \sin(x) \):

\[
2\sin(x) + 1 = 0 \Rightarrow \sin(x) = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]

We then look for all angles \( x \) that have a sine of \( -\frac{1}{2} \). In the interval \( [0, 2\pi) \), these angles would be \( \frac{7\pi}{6} \) and \( \frac{11\pi}{6} \).

To visualize the solution, we can plot the equation \( y = 2\sin(x) + 1 \) and identify the points where the graph intersects the \( x \)-axis.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = \( x \),
    ylabel = \( y \),
    xtick = {3.66519, 5.75959},
    xticklabels = {\(\frac{7\pi}{6}\), \(\frac{11\pi}{6}\)},
    ytick = \empty,
    ymin = -3, ymax = 3,
    xmin = 0, xmax = 2*pi,
    domain = 0:2*pi,
    samples = 100,
    legend pos = south east
]
\addplot [blue, thick] {2*sin(deg(x)) + 1};
\addplot [dotted, thick] {0};
\legend{\(2\sin(x) + 1\)}
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

This graph clearly shows the points of intersection corresponding to the solutions of our linear trigonometric equation.

% \end{document}

\subsection{Practice Problems}
\label{subsec:practice_problems_linear_trig}

\textbf{Problem 1:} Solve the trigonometric equation \( 3\cos(x) = 1.5 \).

\textbf{Problem 2:} Find all solutions in the interval \( [0, 2\pi) \) for the equation \( \tan(x) - \sqrt{3} = 0 \).

\textbf{Problem 3:} Determine the general solution for \( \sin(x) + \frac{1}{2} = 0 \).

\subsection{Solutions to Practice Problems}
\label{subsec:solutions_practice_problems}

\textbf{Solution to Problem 1:} To find the value of \( x \) we divide both sides by 3:
\[
\cos(x) = \frac{1.5}{3} = 0.5.
\]
The solution to this equation is the angles where the cosine is 0.5. In the interval \( [0, 2\pi) \), these are \( x = \frac{\pi}{3} \) and \( x = \frac{5\pi}{3} \).

\textbf{Solution to Problem 2:} We can start by adding \( \sqrt{3} \) to both sides:
\[
\tan(x) = \sqrt{3}.
\]
The solution to this equation is the angles where the tangent is \( \sqrt{3} \), which corresponds to \( x = \frac{\pi}{3} \) and \( x = \frac{4\pi}{3} \) within the interval \( [0, 2\pi) \).

\textbf{Solution to Problem 3:} Subtracting \( \frac{1}{2} \) from both sides gives us:
\[
\sin(x) = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]
The general solution includes all angles where the sine is \( -\frac{1}{2} \). In the interval \( [0, 2\pi) \), the solutions are \( x = \frac{7\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \) and \( x = \frac{11\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \) where \( k \) is any integer.

\chapter{Basic \LaTeX\ Guide}
\section*{A Quick Start to Your \LaTeX\ Journey}

Welcome to the immersive world of \LaTeX, a typesetting system widely used for creating scientific and professional documents due to its powerful handling of formulas and bibliographies. This guide is designed to offer you the foundational steps to grasp the basics of \LaTeX, enabling you to craft documents of high typographic quality akin to this book.

\subsection*{Setting Up Your \LaTeX\ Environment}

Before you can start creating documents with \LaTeX, you need to set up a working \LaTeX\ environment on your computer. Here's how you can do it:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Download and install a \TeX\ distribution, which includes \LaTeX. For Windows, MiKTeX is a popular choice, while Mac users might prefer MacTeX, and TeX Live is widely used on Linux.
    \item Install a \LaTeX\ editor. Some popular options include TeXShop (for Mac), TeXworks (cross-platform), and Overleaf (an online \LaTeX\ editor).
    \item Ensure that your \TeX\ distribution and \LaTeX\ editor are properly configured and integrated.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Creating Your First \LaTeX\ Document}

Once your \LaTeX\ environment is set up, you are ready to create your first \LaTeX\ document. Follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open your \LaTeX\ editor and create a new document.
    \item Insert the following code to set up a basic \LaTeX\ document:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, \LaTeX\ world!
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

    \item Save your document with a .tex file extension.
    \item Compile your document using your \LaTeX\ editor. This process converts your .tex file into a PDF document.
    \item View the output PDF and admire your first \LaTeX\ creation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Understanding \LaTeX\ Commands and Environments}

\LaTeX\ documents are created using a series of commands and environments. Commands typically start with a backslash \textbackslash\ and are used to format text, insert special characters, or execute functions. Environments are used to define specific sections of your document that require special formatting.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Commands:} For example, \textbackslash\textit\{italics\} will render the word "italics" in italic font.
    \item \textbf{Environments:} To create a bulleted list, you would use the \textit{itemize} environment:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
    \item First item
    \item Second item
\end{itemize}
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Adding Structure to Your Document}

\LaTeX\ makes it easy to structure your documents with sections, subsections, and chapters. Here’s how you can add structure:

\begin{verbatim}
\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction of your document.
\subsection{Background}
This subsection provides background information.
\subsubsection{Details}
This is a subsubsection for more detailed information.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Including Mathematical Formulas}

\LaTeX\ excels at typesetting mathematical formulas. Use the \textit{equation} environment or the \textdollar\ sign for inline formulas. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
The quadratic formula is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Adding Images and Tables}

You can also include images and tables in your \LaTeX\ documents:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Images:} Use the \textit{graphicx} package and the \textit{includegraphics} command.
    \item \textbf{Tables:} Use the \textit{tabular} environment to create tables.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Compiling Your Document}

\LaTeX\ documents need to be compiled to produce a PDF. This can be done through your \LaTeX\ editor. If your document includes bibliographies or cross-references, you may need to compile multiple times.

\subsection*{Conclusion: Embracing the Power of \LaTeX}

Congratulations! You have taken your first steps into the world of \LaTeX. With practice, you will discover that \LaTeX\ is a powerful tool for creating professional-quality documents, from simple articles to complex books. Embrace the learning curve, explore the vast array of packages available, and join the community of \LaTeX\ users who are ready to help you on your journey. Happy typesetting!
