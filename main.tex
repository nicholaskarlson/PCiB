\chapter{Topics in Trigonometry}
\subsection*{Understanding the Basic Trig Functions}

\section*{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
Trigonometry is important in pre-calculus studies.

\section{The Unit Circle}
\label{sec:unit_circle}

The unit circle is a fundamental concept in trigonometry. It is a circle with a radius of one unit, centered at the origin (0,0) of the coordinate plane. The unit circle allows us to define all trigonometric functions for any angle, including those greater than 90 degrees.

\subsection{Definition of the Unit Circle}
\label{subsec:unit_circle_definition}

The unit circle is defined as the set of all points \((x, y)\) that satisfy the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). This circle intersects the x-axis at the points \((1, 0)\) and \((-1, 0)\), and the y-axis at the points \((0, 1)\) and \((0, -1)\).

\subsection{Angles and the Unit Circle}
\label{subsec:angles_unit_circle}

In the context of the unit circle, an angle \(\theta\) is defined starting from the positive x-axis and rotating counter-clockwise for positive angles and clockwise for negative angles. This rotation creates an arc on the circle, and the length of this arc is the measure of the angle in radians.

\subsection{Radians and Degrees}
\label{subsec:radians_degrees}

A radian is the measure of an angle corresponding to an arc length equal to the radius of the circle. Since the circumference of the unit circle is \(2\pi\), there are \(2\pi\) radians in a full rotation. To convert radians to degrees, we use the fact that \(360\) degrees is equivalent to \(2\pi\) radians. Therefore, to convert an angle from radians to degrees, we multiply by \(\frac{180}{\pi}\).

\[
\text{degrees} = \text{radians} \times \frac{180}{\pi}
\]

Conversely, to convert from degrees to radians, we multiply by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\).

\[
\text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}
\]

\subsection{Graphing the Unit Circle}
\label{subsec:graphing_unit_circle}

Let's graph the unit circle with the point \((0,1)\) marked:

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
    % Draw the unit circle
    \draw (0,0) circle (2cm);
    % Draw the horizontal and vertical lines
    \draw[->] (-2.5,0) -- (2.5,0) node[right] {\(x\)};
    \draw[->] (0,-2.5) -- (0,2.5) node[above] {\(y\)};
    % Draw the point (0,1)
    \filldraw [black] (0,2) circle (2pt) node[right] {\((0,1)\)};
    % Draw the angle
    \draw[->] (1.5,0) arc (0:90:1.5cm);
    % Label the angle
    \node at (1.2,0.3) {\(\theta\)};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{The unit circle with the point (0,1) marked.}
\label{fig:unit_circle}
\end{figure}

As you can see from Figure \ref{fig:unit_circle}, the unit circle provides a way to visualize angles and trigonometric functions. Each point on the circle corresponds to the cosine and sine of the angle \(\theta\), where the x-coordinate represents the cosine, and the y-coordinate represents the sine.

% End of the unit circle section

% --- Chapter: Trigonometry ---
\chapter{Trigonometry for Calculus}
\label{chap:trigonometry}

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles. It is essential for understanding concepts in calculus, as it provides tools for modeling and solving problems involving periodic phenomena.

% \section{Angles and Their Measure}
% \label{sec:angles_measure}
% Every study of Trigonometry begins with an understanding of angles. Here, we discuss how angles are measured in both degrees and radians, and the importance of radian measure in calculus.

\section{Angles and Their Measure}
\label{sec:angles_measure}

Every study of Trigonometry begins with an understanding of angles. Angles can be measured in two primary ways: degrees and radians. Degrees are traditionally used in many fields and cultures, and there are \(360\) degrees in a full rotation. Radians, however, provide a more natural approach in mathematics, especially calculus, because they arise from the arc length of a circle.

\subsection{Degree Measure}
\label{subsec:degree_measure}

One degree is defined as \(\frac{1}{360}\) of a full rotation. The degree measure is subdivided into minutes and seconds, where one degree contains \(60\) minutes and one minute contains \(60\) seconds.

\subsection{Radian Measure}
\label{subsec:radian_measure}

A radian is a measure based on the radius of a circle. It is the angle created at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. Since the circumference of a circle is \(2\pi\) times the radius, a full rotation contains \(2\pi\) radians.

\subsection{Converting Between Degrees and Radians}
\label{subsec:converting_degrees_radians}

To convert from degrees to radians, we use the relationship that \(180\) degrees is equal to \(\pi\) radians. Therefore, to convert \(x\) degrees to radians, we multiply \(x\) by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\).

\[
\text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}
\]

Conversely, to convert from radians to degrees, we multiply the radian measure by \(\frac{180}{\pi}\).

\[
\text{degrees} = \text{radians} \times \frac{180}{\pi}
\]

% \subsection{Degree Measure}
% \label{subsec:degree_measure}
% An angle's measure in degrees reflects the extent of rotation from the initial side to the terminal side.

\subsection{Degree Measure}
\label{subsec:degree_measure}
The measurement of an angle in degrees is a reflection of the rotation from the angle's initial side to its terminal side. One full rotation around a circle is equal to 360 degrees, meaning that a degree represents \(\frac{1}{360}\)th of a full rotation. This form of measurement originates from the ancient Babylonians, who had a base-60 number system and divided the circle into 360 parts.

To visualize an angle measured in degrees, consider the following figure created using the TikZ package. It shows an angle of 45 degrees, which is an eighth of a full 360-degree rotation.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2.5]
  % Draw the circle
  \draw (0,0) circle (1cm);
  
  % Draw the radius
  \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (0:1cm) node[below] {$(1,0)$};
  \draw[thick] (0,0) -- (45:1cm) node[above right] {$(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$};
  
  % Draw the arc for the angle
  \draw[->,red,thick] (0.5,0) arc (0:45:0.5cm);
  
  % Draw the angle
  \node[red] at (22.5:0.7cm) {$45^\circ$};
  
  % Draw the horizontal line
  \draw[dashed] (0.707,0) -- (0.707,0.707);
  
  % Label the origin
  \draw[fill=black] (0,0) circle (0.5pt) node[below left] {$O$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Illustration of a \(45^\circ\) angle in standard position.}
\label{fig:45degangle}
\end{figure}

The figure above illustrates an angle whose terminal side has rotated \(45^\circ\) from the positive x-axis, which is often referred to as the angle's initial side. The radius of the circle has a length of 1, hence the name "unit circle." The coordinates \((1,0)\) and \((\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\) correspond to the points where the radius intersects the x-axis and the circle, respectively. The dashed line represents the y-component of the terminal side's endpoint, helping to visualize the \(45^\circ\) angle as a right triangle within the circle.

Angles in degrees are widely used in various fields, including navigation, astronomy, and in everyday situations like measuring temperatures and geographic coordinates. Understanding how to measure angles in degrees and relate them to rotations is fundamental in trigonometry.

\end{itemize}

% You can create similar TikZ figures for Problem 3 if you wish to provide visual aids for the students.

% \subsection{Radian Measure}
% \label{subsec:radian_measure}
% Radian measure is crucial in calculus because it simplifies the derivatives and integrals of trigonometric functions.

\subsection{Radian Measure}
\label{subsec:radian_measure}

The radian measure of an angle is the length of the arc on the unit circle subtended by the angle. One radian is the angle subtended by an arc length equal to the radius of the circle. Since the circumference of a unit circle is \(2\pi\) times the radius, a full rotation around the circle is \(2\pi\) radians.

\subsubsection*{Why Use Radians?}
In calculus, radian measure is preferred because it provides a direct relationship between the angle measure and the arc length. This relationship simplifies the computation of derivatives and integrals involving trigonometric functions. For instance, when using radians, the derivative of \(\sin x\) is simply \(\cos x\), and the derivative of \(\cos x\) is \(-\sin x\). Such simplicity is not evident when using degrees.

\subsubsection*{Visualizing Radian Measure}
To visualize an angle in radian measure, we plot it on the unit circle:

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Solutions}

      \item \( 180^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \pi \text{ radians} \)
      \item \( 360^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = 2\pi \text{ radians} \)
      \item \( 90^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ radians} \)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item The length of an arc \( l \) is directly proportional to the angle \( \theta \) in radians, such that \( l = r\theta \).
  \item The radian measure of the angle is \( \theta = \frac{l}{r} = \frac{15 \text{ units}}{10 \text{ units}} = 1.5 \text{ radians} \).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems}
Here are some practice problems to help you solidify your understanding of the radian measure:

\textbf{Problem 1:} Convert the following angles from radians to degrees:

% \section{Trigonometric Functions}
% \label{sec:trigonometric_functions}
% The six trigonometric functions are the primary tools for handling problems involving triangles in Trigonometry and periodic phenomena in calculus.

\section{Trigonometric Functions}
\label{sec:trigonometric_functions}
The six trigonometric functions are fundamental in both Trigonometry and calculus. These functions are sine (\(\sin\)), cosine (\(\cos\)), tangent (\(\tan\)), cosecant (\(\csc\)), secant (\(\sec\)), and cotangent (\(\cot\)). They are defined as ratios of sides in a right triangle or as certain coordinates of points on the unit circle.

\subsection{Sine and Cosine}
\label{subsec:sine_cosine}
The sine function (\(\sin\)) represents the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle. The cosine function (\(\cos\)) represents the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.

For a point \((x, y)\) on the unit circle corresponding to an angle \(\theta\), the sine and cosine values are \(y\) and \(x\), respectively.

\subsubsection*{Graph of Sine and Cosine Functions}
We can graph the sine and cosine functions using their values from the unit circle.

% Graphing sine and cosine functions
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    width=10cm, height=6cm,
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = {$\theta$},
    ylabel = {$y$},
    ymin=-1.5, ymax=1.5,
    xmin=-0.5, xmax=6.5,
    xtick={0,1.57,3.14,4.71,6.28},
    xticklabels={0,$\frac{\pi}{2}$,$\pi$,$\frac{3\pi}{2}$,$2\pi$},
    ytick={-1,1},
    every axis x label/.style={at={(ticklabel* cs:1)},anchor=west},
    every axis y label/.style={at={(ticklabel* cs:1)},anchor=south},
    ]
    \addplot[domain=0:2*pi,samples=100,blue] {sin(deg(x))};
    \addplot[domain=0:2*pi,samples=100,red] {cos(deg(x))};
    \legend{$\sin(\theta)$,$\cos(\theta)$}
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The sine function starts at \(0\), reaches its maximum at \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), returns to \(0\) at \(\pi\), reaches its minimum at \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\), and completes the cycle at \(2\pi\).

The cosine function starts at \(1\), drops to \(0\) at \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), reaches its minimum at \(\pi\), returns to \(0\) at \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\), and completes the cycle at \(2\pi\).

\subsection{Tangent Function}
\label{subsec:tangent_function}
The tangent function (\(\tan\)) is defined as the ratio of the sine to the cosine of an angle in a right triangle, or \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}\). It represents the slope of the line that intersects the unit circle at an angle \(\theta\).

\subsection{Reciprocal Functions}
\label{subsec:reciprocal_functions}
The reciprocal functions, cosecant (\(\csc\)), secant (\(\sec\)), and cotangent (\(\cot\)), are the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, respectively.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Cosecant (\(\csc(\theta)\)) is the reciprocal of sine: \(\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}\)
  \item Secant (\(\sec(\theta)\)) is the reciprocal of cosine: \(\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}\)
  \item Cotangent (\(\cot(\theta)\)) is the reciprocal of tangent: \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)}\)
\end{itemize}

  \item Find the exact value of \(\cot\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right)\).

      \item \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)
      \item \(\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)}{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\)

      \item \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\)
    \end{itemize}
  \item For \(\cos(\theta) = -\frac{1}{2}\) in the third quadrant:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(\sin(\theta)\) must also be negative in the third quadrant, and \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\), so \(\sin(\theta) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

% \subsection{Sine and Cosine}
% \label{subsec:sine_cosine}
% The sine and cosine functions relate an angle to the opposite side and hypotenuse, and adjacent side and hypotenuse of a right triangle, respectively.

\subsection{Sine and Cosine}
\label{subsec:sine_cosine}

The sine and cosine functions are fundamental to trigonometry. They are defined for a given angle \( \theta \) within a right-angled triangle as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{sine} of angle \( \theta \), written as \( \sin(\theta) \), is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.
    \item The \textbf{cosine} of angle \( \theta \), written as \( \cos(\theta) \), is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.
\end{itemize}

However, these definitions are not limited to angles between 0 and \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians (or 0 and 90 degrees). By extending the concept of the unit circle, where the radius is 1 and the center is at the origin of a coordinate plane, we can define sine and cosine for any real angle.

\subsubsection*{Sine and Cosine on the Unit Circle}
Consider the unit circle with a point \( P(x, y) \) that corresponds to an angle \( \theta \) measured from the positive x-axis. The coordinates \( x \) and \( y \) of point \( P \) on the unit circle are equal to \( \cos(\theta) \) and \( \sin(\theta) \), respectively.

    \draw[dashed] (1.732,1) -- (0,1);
    \draw (1.5,0) -- (1.5,0.2) -- (1.7,0.2);
    \node at (1.732,1) [circle,fill,inner sep=1.5pt]{};
    \node at (1.732,1) [right] {$P (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$};
    \node at (0.866,0) [below] {$\cos \theta$};

    \node at (0.5,0.1) [above right] {$\theta$};
    \draw (0.3,0) arc (0:60:0.3cm);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The unit circle approach allows for a seamless transition of sine and cosine from acute angles to any angle in the coordinate plane. The definitions on the unit circle are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For any angle \( \theta \), \( \sin(\theta) \) is the y-coordinate of the corresponding point on the unit circle.
    \item For any angle \( \theta \), \( \cos(\theta) \) is the x-coordinate of the corresponding point on the unit circle.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Properties of Sine and Cosine Functions}

The sine and cosine functions have several important properties that are useful in various mathematical analyses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item They are periodic functions with a period of \( 2\pi \) radians (or 360 degrees).
    \item The sine function is odd: \( \sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta) \).
    \item The cosine function is even: \( \cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta) \).
    \item The maximum value of both functions is 1, and the minimum value is -1.
    \item They satisfy the Pythagorean identity: \( \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1 \).
\end{itemize}

Understanding these functions and their properties is crucial for solving problems involving periodic behavior and waves, and they are the building blocks for defining the other trigonometric functions.

% Further discussion and examples can be added here as needed.

\subsubsection*{Example Problems}
Below are some problems that help solidify the understanding of sine and cosine functions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given that \( P(x, y) \) is a point on the unit circle corresponding to an angle \( \theta \), and \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), find \( y \) and hence \( \sin(\theta) \) and \( \cos(\theta) \).
    \item Prove the Pythagorean identity \( \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1 \) using the definition of sine and cosine on the unit circle.
    \item If \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{3}{5} \) and \( \theta \) is in the first quadrant, find \( \cos(\theta) \).
    \item For an angle \( \theta \) with \( \cos(\theta) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( \frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \pi \), determine \( \sin(\theta) \).
    \item Using the unit circle, find the exact values of \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{6}) \), \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) \), \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) \), \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{6}) \), \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) \), and \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{3}) \).
    \item Sketch the unit circle and mark the points where \( \sin(\theta) = \cos(\theta) \). What are the angles \( \theta \) at these points?
\end{enumerate}

% Answers to the example problems
\subsubsection*{Answers to Example Problems}

Here are the answers to the example problems provided:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Since \( x = \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \), we have \( y = \sin(\theta) = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).
    \item To prove the identity, we use the fact that for any point on the unit circle, the distance from the origin to the point is 1. Hence, \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Since \( x = \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = \sin(\theta) \), it follows that \( \cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1 \).
    \item Since \( \theta \) is in the first quadrant, both sine and cosine are positive. Using the Pythagorean identity, \( \cos(\theta) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(\theta)} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{9}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{16}{25}} = \frac{4}{5} \).
    \item In the second quadrant, sine is positive and cosine is negative. Using the Pythagorean identity, \( \sin(\theta) = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(\theta)} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
    \item For the specified angles, the exact values can be determined from the known special angles on the unit circle: \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{1}{2} \), \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), \( \sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), \( \cos(\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{1}{2} \).
    \item On the unit circle, \( \sin(\theta) = \cos(\theta) \) at \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \theta = \frac{5\pi}{4} \). These correspond to the points \( (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \) and \( (-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \), respectively.

% \subsection{Tangent and Cotangent}
% \label{subsec:tangent_cotangent}
% These functions are the ratios of sine to cosine and cosine to sine, respectively, and they play a significant role in slope calculations in calculus.

\subsection{Tangent and Cotangent}
\label{subsec:tangent_cotangent}

The tangent of an angle in a right-angled triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. In the unit circle, tangent is the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate when the line made by the angle intersects the circle. Symbolically, for an angle \(\theta\), this is expressed as:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}
\]

Conversely, the cotangent is the reciprocal of the tangent function. It represents the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the opposite side, or using the unit circle, the x-coordinate divided by the y-coordinate:
\[
\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}
\]

These functions are undefined when their denominators are zero (i.e., when \(\cos(\theta) = 0\) for tangent, and when \(\sin(\theta) = 0\) for cotangent). This occurs at odd multiples of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) for tangent and at integer multiples of \(\pi\) for cotangent.

The graphs of these functions illustrate their periodic nature and the locations of their asymptotes, which correspond to the angles where the functions are undefined.

In calculus, the tangent function is particularly important when it comes to determining the slope of a curve at a point, which is essential for understanding the concept of derivatives. Cotangent can similarly be used, especially when dealing with the slope of reciprocal functions.

\subsection{Exercises on Tangent and Cotangent Functions}
\label{subsec:exercises_tangent_cotangent}

In this section, we provide some example problems involving the tangent and cotangent functions. These exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts discussed and help students gain a deeper understanding of these trigonometric functions.

% \begin{exercise}[1]
%   Prove that \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) for a right triangle with legs of length \(a\) and \(b\), and hypotenuse of length \(c\).
% \end{exercise}

% \begin{solution}
%   (Write your solution here)
% \end{solution}

% Numbering is optional, i.e.
% \begin{exercise}[1]
% \begin{exercise}[2]


\begin{exercise}
Calculate the tangent of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) and verify that it equals 1.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
Using the unit circle or the definition of the tangent function, we have:
\[
\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)}{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 1
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Find all solutions in the interval \([0, 2\pi)\) for the equation \(\tan(\theta) = \sqrt{3}\).
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
We know that \(\tan(\theta) = \sqrt{3}\) when \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}\), but since tangent has a period of \(\pi\), the other solution in the given interval is \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{3} + \pi = \frac{4\pi}{3}\).
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Evaluate \(\cot(\pi)\) and explain why it takes its particular value.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
Cotangent is the reciprocal of the tangent function. Since \(\tan(\pi) = 0\), and since the cotangent is undefined when its sine component is 0 (which it is at \(\pi\)), \(\cot(\pi)\) is undefined. This reflects the asymptote of the cotangent graph at \(\pi\).
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Determine the exact value of \(\cot\left(-\frac{\pi}{6}\right)\) using the cotangent definition.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
Using the cotangent definition and known values of sine and cosine for \(\frac{\pi}{6}\), we get:
\[
\cot\left(-\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{6}\right)}{\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{6}\right)} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{-\frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Sketch the graph of \(\tan(\theta)\) and \(\cot(\theta)\) from \(\theta = -\frac{\pi}{2}\) to \(\theta = \frac{3\pi}{2}\) and label the asymptotes.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
Students should refer to the graphs provided in the section above and reproduce them by hand, marking the asymptotes at \(\theta = -\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for the tangent function and at \(\theta = 0\), \(\theta = \pi\) for the cotangent function.
\end{solution}

These exercises require students to apply their understanding of the unit circle, the definitions of tangent and cotangent, and the properties of these functions such as periodicity and asymptotes. Students should attempt these exercises without a calculator to improve their understanding of the trigonometric functions.

\chapter{Basic \LaTeX\ Guide}
\section*{A Quick Start to Your \LaTeX\ Journey}

Welcome to the immersive world of \LaTeX, a typesetting system widely used for creating scientific and professional documents due to its powerful handling of formulas and bibliographies. This guide is designed to offer you the foundational steps to grasp the basics of \LaTeX, enabling you to craft documents of high typographic quality akin to this book.

\subsection*{Setting Up Your \LaTeX\ Environment}

Before you can start creating documents with \LaTeX, you need to set up a working \LaTeX\ environment on your computer. Here's how you can do it:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Download and install a \TeX\ distribution, which includes \LaTeX. For Windows, MiKTeX is a popular choice, while Mac users might prefer MacTeX, and TeX Live is widely used on Linux.
    \item Install a \LaTeX\ editor. Some popular options include TeXShop (for Mac), TeXworks (cross-platform), and Overleaf (an online \LaTeX\ editor).
    \item Ensure that your \TeX\ distribution and \LaTeX\ editor are properly configured and integrated.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Creating Your First \LaTeX\ Document}

Once your \LaTeX\ environment is set up, you are ready to create your first \LaTeX\ document. Follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open your \LaTeX\ editor and create a new document.
    \item Insert the following code to set up a basic \LaTeX\ document:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, \LaTeX\ world!
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

    \item Save your document with a .tex file extension.
    \item Compile your document using your \LaTeX\ editor. This process converts your .tex file into a PDF document.
    \item View the output PDF and admire your first \LaTeX\ creation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Understanding \LaTeX\ Commands and Environments}

\LaTeX\ documents are created using a series of commands and environments. Commands typically start with a backslash \textbackslash\ and are used to format text, insert special characters, or execute functions. Environments are used to define specific sections of your document that require special formatting.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Commands:} For example, \textbackslash\textit\{italics\} will render the word "italics" in italic font.
    \item \textbf{Environments:} To create a bulleted list, you would use the \textit{itemize} environment:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
    \item First item
    \item Second item
\end{itemize}
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Adding Structure to Your Document}

\LaTeX\ makes it easy to structure your documents with sections, subsections, and chapters. Here’s how you can add structure:

\begin{verbatim}
\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction of your document.
\subsection{Background}
This subsection provides background information.
\subsubsection{Details}
This is a subsubsection for more detailed information.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Including Mathematical Formulas}

\LaTeX\ excels at typesetting mathematical formulas. Use the \textit{equation} environment or the \textdollar\ sign for inline formulas. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
The quadratic formula is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Adding Images and Tables}

You can also include images and tables in your \LaTeX\ documents:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Images:} Use the \textit{graphicx} package and the \textit{includegraphics} command.
    \item \textbf{Tables:} Use the \textit{tabular} environment to create tables.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Compiling Your Document}

\LaTeX\ documents need to be compiled to produce a PDF. This can be done through your \LaTeX\ editor. If your document includes bibliographies or cross-references, you may need to compile multiple times.

\subsection*{Conclusion: Embracing the Power of \LaTeX}

Congratulations! You have taken your first steps into the world of \LaTeX. With practice, you will discover that \LaTeX\ is a powerful tool for creating professional-quality documents, from simple articles to complex books. Embrace the learning curve, explore the vast array of packages available, and join the community of \LaTeX\ users who are ready to help you on your journey. Happy typesetting!
